# codingchallenge5
This challenge has us create a code that calculates employee salaries.We also use a extending sublclass to add in the manager and department.  We use a method to calculate the salary, bonus, and total anual salary. Lastly we creat a subclass to input test data if their name, annual salary, and hours. Then we implement code to show the managers annual salaries with bonuse's. This challenge provided great practice with java code, more specifically extending class, adding subclass, and calculations.
